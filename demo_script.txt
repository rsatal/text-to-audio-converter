Hello and welcome to our demonstration of the RCABot.

When an engineer encounters this issue, rather than spending hours investigating from scratch, they can simply enter the command /RCABot to initiate our automated analysis.

The bot immediately begins analyzing logs, metrics, and system state to quickly identify the root cause.

This not only saves valuable engineering time but also ensures consistent troubleshooting approaches across the organization.

Let's see it in action!
